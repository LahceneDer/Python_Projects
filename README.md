# Python_Projects

## 1- First Project :

  In this script, I use Python and its ecosystem of libraries to scrape information from a website and create a dataset of CSV file(s).
Here are the steps I follow to build a web scraping project from scratch:

✅ Pick a website and identify the information to be scraped into a CSV file

💾 Use the requests library to download web pages from the site programmatically

💬 Use Beautiful Soup to parse and extract information from web pages

📝 Create well-formatted CSV file(s) with the extracted information
